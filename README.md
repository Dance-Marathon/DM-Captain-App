DM Captain App
===========

The Dance Marathon Captain Application is an online form that was used by [Dance Marathon at the University of Florida](http://floridadm.org) in 2012 to process applications for captain positions for the 2012-2013 school year.

It is an early example of my php work and my first project to take advantage of jQuery. There was no source control on the original version of this app and it was added to github so I could work with [esmith](https://github.com/smith1302) to update it for the following school year.
